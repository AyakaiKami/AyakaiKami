# Hi there! My name is Stefan.
### Welcome to my GitHub profile.

## About Me:
### I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a constant drive to expand my knowledge in the field. I have a strong interest in Ethical Hacking, Vulnerability Research, and the Penetration Testing process. My passion lies in understanding the lifecycle of vulnerabilitiesâ€”how they arise, how they are identified and exploited, and most importantly, how they can be mitigated.
